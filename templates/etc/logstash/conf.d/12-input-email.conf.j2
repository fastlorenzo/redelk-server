# # In this file we configure the logstash input for remote email resources

# #
# # You need to configure this file to. Ive included a few examples for known email providers.
# # A few things to note:
# #   - Make sure to enable IMAP at the email provider's side if required. Note, Gmail also requires 'allow less secure devices' in Gmail security settings.
# #   - The provider may block you if you check for email too often, are coming from a suspicious email or some other
# #     'magic anti-spam measure'. It differs per provider how you should handle this (e.g. Gmail wants you to do a captcha
# #     from your IP at https://www.google.com/accounts/DisplayUnlockCaptcha)
# #   - OPSEC issue: unless you are using an outbound proxy on your RedELK host, this config will expose the RedELK's ext IP to the email provider.
# #   - In our testing the 'Sent' items weren't always imported from the start. A fix that seem to work is toggle all sent emails as 'unread' once
# #   - Folder names need to be exact, and they aren't the same at every provider. You can check the names manually by doing:
# #     openssl s_client -connect remote.imapprovider.com:993 -crlf
# #     a1 login username p4ssw0rd
# #     a2 LIST "" "*"
# #
