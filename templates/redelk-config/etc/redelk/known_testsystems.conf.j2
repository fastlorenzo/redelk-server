# You define known test systems based on:
#  - query_mode: this can be AND or OR - it instructs the logical operator to use when matching the items
#  - target_user: the username that is running the beacon
#  - target_hostname: the hostname of the system running the beacon
#  - target_ipint: the internal IP address of the system running the beacon (CIRD notation) or * for any
#
# Each value can contain the * wildcard, either for the full value or for part of it.
